## Storyblok CMS

Storyblok is used for the CMS. Credentials are in 1Password under **[VGT] Storyblok**. _Edits in Storyblok only trigger production builds._ To refresh content in a branch or PR build, a build of that environment must be manually triggered.

## Setup

```sh
nvm use && npm install
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Application.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ storyblok/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ bloks/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ components/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal. Make sure to `nvm use`!
